# Trillo

Project using only HTML and SCSS to learn development with Flexbox and implementing responsive design, with no Javascript and therefore no functionality. 
- Using Media Queries at different viewport dimensions for different devices
- Flexbox positioning (flex-direction, align-items, justify-content etc..)
- Practice development with SCSS, and using NPM packages to install SASS locally.
